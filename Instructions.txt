You should have something like the above

To run a new container based upon your image run the following command 

docker run --name poshc2-python -ti poshc2-python:latest /bin/bash

This will place you in a bash shell inside the running container, from here run

From here enter:

chmod +x /root/tmux-sessions.sh
/root/tmux-session.sh

This script will create a tmux session with 2 windows one window split into 2 panes with C2Server running on the left and ImplantHandler on the right.
Tmux uses Ctrl + b as its prefix

To switch windows Ctrl +b n

To scroll a panes you have to enter whats called copy mode via Ctrl +b [ then use the arrow keys and / or page up/down

You can detach from tmux by using ctrl + b d, this will leave PoshC2 running, just as in screen.

To detach from the running docker container enter ctrl p and then ctrl q

To enter the running container:
